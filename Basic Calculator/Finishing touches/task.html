<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Your app can calculate things. But you can still improve the app by automating some of its features.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>1. Clean <code class="java">editText</code> automatically after choosing an operation. Let's also set the entered value as a hint, so that users can see that they have typed everything correctly.<br>
    2. If you're using <code class="java">Double</code>, you get <code class="java">.0</code> in your result. Get rid of it when a result is a whole number.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>An example of your program</em></p>
